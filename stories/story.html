Downstairs, she *found* a note from her mom: "Overslept, *went* to work early. Toast on the table." Mia *took* the slice of **crispy** toast, *ate* it in two bites, and *drank* her juice. She *knew* she *had* to *leave* immediately. Her backpack *lay* by the door. She *caught* it, *said* a quick goodbye, and *ran* out. The morning sun *shone* brightly, illuminating the **path**. Mia *understood* she *would* be significantly late. She *ran* towards school, her breath *came* in short bursts, hoping her teacher *would* understand.`,

        content: `Mia *awoke* with an abrupt *jolt*, her heart *pounding*. The **oblivious** alarm clock, typically her unwavering sentinel, *had remained* silent. Her gaze *flew* to the digital display: 8:00 AM! School *was set* to *begin* in a mere fifteen minutes. A surge of visceral panic *shot* through her veins. She *sprang* from her bed, adrenaline *coursing* through her. She *flew* into the bathroom, *threw* icy water onto her face, and *put* on her meticulously prepared school uniform. Downstairs, a hastily scribbled note from her mother *lay* on the counter: "Overslept, *went* to work early. Help yourself to the toast." Mia *took* a piece of the now-cold, **stale** toast, *ate* it in two rapid bites, and *drank* her juice. She *knew* she *had* to *flee* without another second's delay. Her satchel *hung* by the entryway. She *held* it, *bid* a silent farewell to the deserted house, and *burst* out the front door. The morning sun *shone* with a blinding intensity, casting long shadows across the familiar **thoroughfare**. Mia *understood* she *would* undoubtedly incur significant tardiness. She *ran* towards the school gates, her lungs *felt* like they *would burst*, hoping her form teacher *would show* some leniency.`,
