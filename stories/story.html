He *ran* back inside. He *found* it on the table. He *came* out again and *ran* very fast to school. He *came* into class. The teacher *saw* him. Leo *felt* very **shy**.

He *ran* like the wind all the way to school. He *burst* into the classroom, breathless. His teacher, Mrs. Davis, *gave* him a **stern** look. Leo *felt* his face *grow* red.

A bracing, frigid shower *gave* him a momentary jolt before he *wore* his wrinkled uniform. He *ran* to the kitchen, where he *ate* a piece of toast and *drank* his juice, a sense of urgency *driving* every movement. *Taking* his satchel, he *flew* out the front door, *felt convinced* he *had* barely made up lost time. However, a sudden, **agonizing** thought *struck* him: his meticulously crafted history essay! He *spun* on his heel, *ran* back inside, *found* it precisely where he *had left* it, and *took* it. He *sped* through the streets, his lungs *burning*, until he *burst* into the classroom, his entrance creating a palpable ripple of attention. Mrs. Davis, his history teacher, *gave* him a **reproachful** gaze. Leo *felt* a deep flush *creep* up his neck.
