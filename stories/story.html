He *ran* to the kitchen. His mom *made* breakfast. He *ate* it very quickly. He *took* his bag and *went* out the door. He *ran* all the way to school. When he *came* to class, his teacher *was* there. She *knew* he *was* late. He *did* not like that. He *missed* the math test. He *felt* sad. He *knew* he *had* to **set** his alarm louder next time. He *made* a promise to himself to *sleep* earlier. What a **messy** morning!`,

School *started* at 8:30! A wave of panic *swept* over him. He *leapt* out of bed and *ran* to the kitchen where his mother *stood*, finishing breakfast. He *ate* quickly. He *grabbed* his backpack, *took* a quick goodbye, and *flew* out the door, *running* as fast as his legs *could* *take* him. When he *got* to school, the hallways *were* silent. He *crept* into class, but his teacher *already* *knew* he *was* late. He *had* *missed* the first periodâ€”an important science test. He *felt* a pang of **regret**. He *understood* he *had* *brought* this upon himself. He *made* a mental note to **prioritize** sleep and *set* two alarms from now on.`,

        content: `Liam *awoke* abruptly, a **torrent** of sunlight *shot* through a gap in his curtains. He *saw* his digital clock: 8:00 AM. A jolt of adrenaline *ran* through him. School *began* in thirty minutes! A profound sense of dread *swept* over him, replacing his usual morning *languor*. He *leapt* from his bed, his mind *went* into overdrive, and he *fled* to the kitchen. His mother *stood* by the stove, seemingly unfazed, as he *ate* his breakfast, the usual flavors *lost* amidst his burgeoning panic. He *took* his satchel, *bid* a rushed farewell, and *flung* himself out the door, *running* with a frantic intensity that *left* him breathless. The school corridors *were* eerily silent when he *crept* into his classroom, only to *find* his teacher, Ms. Evans, *had* *already* *taken* attendance. He *had* *missed* the crucial English literature test. A wave of bitter **chagrin** *came* over him. He *knew* he *had* *brought* this predicament upon himself, a direct consequence of his late-night gaming. He *swore* to **rectify** his habits, *resolving* to *go* to bed earlier and *set* multiple alarms, determined that such a calamitous start *would* never again *befall* him.`,
